The **Cyber Incident Tracker for Electric Power Systems** ([CITEPS](https://github.com/substationworm/CITEPS/blob/main/CITEPS.md)) is an open-access repository designed to catalog cybersecurity incidents specifically affecting the electric power sector, with a focus on events involving operational technology (OT) assets and industrial control systems (ICS).

[CITEPS](https://github.com/substationworm/CITEPS/blob/main/CITEPS.md) is structured around cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and provides insights to support defensive strategies, risk assessment, and adversary simulation in the electric power sector.

[CITEPS](https://github.com/substationworm/CITEPS/blob/main/CITEPS.md) is an initiative linked to scientific research and technological innovation projects coordinated by [Prof. Dr. Luiz F. Freitas-Gutierres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lffreitas-gutierres/) and carried out at the Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br/)), in collaboration with external institutions.
